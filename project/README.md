# Design and Simulation of Circuits and Embedded Systems

 ## Water level monitoring system
 
   A Water Level Indicator is used to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container. In this paper,
   we investigated the design of a water level sensor device using Arudino UNO, that can detect the level of water in a water storage system.
   An ultrasonic sensor is used to generate ultrasonic waves, a water sensor to detect the water level, LEDs to signify the importance of different
   water levels, PC to observe the levels of water. We indicated a green LED for safe water level, one red LED for about to reach max level and two red 
   LEDs for maximum water level. This circuit is efficient and can be used for any application involving the levels of any liquid.
