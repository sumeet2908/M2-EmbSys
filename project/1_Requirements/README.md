# Description

# Abstract

A Water Level Indicator is used to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water 
container. In this paper, we investigated the design of a water level sensor device using Arudino UNO, that can 
detect the level of water in a water storage system. An ultrasonic sensor is used to generate ultrasonic waves, a 
water sensor to detect the water level, LEDs to signify the importance of different water levels, PC to observe the 
levels of water. We indicated a green LED for safe water level, one red LED for about to reach max level and two 
red LEDs for maximum water level. This circuit is efficient and can be used for any application involving the 
levels of any liquid

# Features

 1) Save Power: In an era of energy conservation, these devices are very beneficial to save energy. Hence 
electrical power wastage can be reduced. These sensor control water levels and minimize the usage of 
electricity
2) Automatically works: These sensors can work automatically when connected to timer devices.
3) These are low cost and easy to install devices
4) The design is compact and with low maintenance and cam clearly indicate the water levels in the overhead 
tank
5) AS they can be fully automatic, they save time and avoid seepage of roofs and walls due to overflowing tanks.
6) These sensors take less energy and can be used for continuous operation

# Components
 
 ## Arduino UNO
    the uno is a great choice for your first arduino. it's got everything you need to get started, and  nothing you don't.
    it has 14 digital input/output pins 6 analog inputs, a usb connection, a power jack, a reset button and more. it 
    contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a usb  cable or power
    it with a ac-to-dc adapter or battery to get started.

 ## Water level sensor
    Level sensors are used to detect the level of substances that can flow. Such substances include liquids, slurries, granular
    material and powders. Level measurements can be done inside containers or it can be the level of a river or lake.
    
 ## Connecting wires
   Connecting wires allows an electrical current to travel from one point on a circuit to another because electricity needs 
   a medium through which it can move. Most of the connecting wires are made up of copper or aluminum
   
 ## LED lights
   An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is
   visible light.
   
 ## Servo-motor
    A servomotor (or servo motor) is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise
    control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.
    
 ## potentiometer
    A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.
    If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.
   
 ## Resistors
   It is a device that has electrical resistance and that is used in an electric circuit for protection, operation, or current
   control.
