## Introduction

Knowing the level of water in an overhead tank is a tedious task which usually leads to climbing up the stairs to 
the tank and checking the level manually or allowing the water overflowing from the top. But electronic water 
level indicators can fix this issue. Most of the available systems use dipped electrodes or float switches, which 
may not perform well in the long run. This project provides a different approach to knowing the water level using 
an Ultrasonic module with Arduino and with LEDs. This method is contactless, so issues like corrosion of the 
electrodes won’t affect this system. The initial electric water controllers in the early 1990’s helped professionals 
to track water levels in chemical industries, and also in agricultural and irrigation projects. They were initially 
used in tracking liquid levels in irrigation lakes, water tanks, boilers etc. However, the initial designs proved to 
be imperfect and a long-term solution were attempted with solid state electronics. These new solid-state 
electronics along with integrated electronics offer greater performance with low cost as well efficient along with 
easy installation. Also monitoring with the help of LEDs can make the operators have an advantage to visually 
scan the issue in order to perform suitable operation.
Water level sensors indicators are devices which can manage the levels of water on a variety of applications such 
as water tubs, pumps, pools etc. their main function is to monitor the flow of water and optimize the system 
performance.
the facility requirements in many industries, farms, hostels, hotels, offices include an overhead 
tank for water, which is usually fed through an electric pump that is switched off when the tank is filled 
up and switched on when it is empty. so, the most common way of knowing when the tank is filled is by 
observing when it overflows the brim. depending on the type of liquid being handled, overfilling of such 
a tank could lead to a great liquid material losses ranging in the order of thousands of naira per week 
depending on the extent of such application. these losses can be prevented if the tank is monitored 
automatically by incorporating a feedback. 
 water level indicator using ultrasonic sensor &arduino is an amazing and very useful project. the 
objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead water 
tank. this project can be further enhanced to control the water level in the tank by turning it on, when the 
water level is low, and turning it off when the water level is high. thus, the arduino water level indicator 
helps in preventing wastage of water in overhead tank. 
 a transmitter circuit and a receiver circuit. the transmitter circuit makes use of an 
ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in terms of distance. this data is sent to the receiver circuit 
using rf communication.
